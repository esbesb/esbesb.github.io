    <h2> What is Djnago? </h2>
      <p id="django_green"> <a href = "https://www.djangoproject.com/"> Django </a> (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ jang-goh) is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. A web framework is a set of components that helps you to develop websites faster and easier.
    <h2> What do we need a framework? </h2>
      <p> To understand what Django is actually for, we need to take a closer look at the servers. The first thing is that the server needs to know that you want it to serve you a web page.<br>
      Imagine a mailbox (port) which is monitored for incoming letters (requests). This is done by a web server. The web server reads the letter and then sends a response with a webpage. But when you want to send something, you need to have some content. And Django is something that helps you create the content.<br/>
